Solitaire Cipher's PHP Implementation

Fill `$deckUnparsed` with your 54 card ordered deck, spacing each element:
*Joker A = `A`
*Joker B = `B`

*Rank; Ace = `A`, Ten = `T`, Jack = `J`, Queen =  `Q`, King = `K` and the remainings as a number in range (`2`, `9`) 
*Suit; Clubs = `c`, Diamonds = `d`, Hearts = `h`, Spades = `s`.

Each element represents one card, for example:
"Queen of Spades, 3 of Hearts, 1 of Diamonds and Joker B" can be expressed as `Qs 3h 1d B`.
